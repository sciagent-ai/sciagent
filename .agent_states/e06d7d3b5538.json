This is essential for:\n- Any task with 3+ steps\n- Tasks with multiple components\n- Tasks where you might lose track of progress\n\n### When to Create Todos\n\nCreate todos IMMEDIATELY when you receive:\n- Multiple tasks (numbered or listed)\n- A complex task requiring several components\n- Keywords indicating hidden requirements:\n  - \"novel\" / \"vs\" / \"compare\" \u2192 need validation/comparison component\n  - \"save\" / \"export\" / \"persist\" \u2192 need persistence component\n  - \"test\" / \"verify\" \u2192 need testing component\n\n### Todo Discipline\n\n- Create todos BEFORE starting work, not during\n- Mark in_progress BEFORE starting a task\n- Mark completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch)\n- One in_progress at a time\n- If stuck 3+ attempts on same task \u2192 add new todo \"Try alternative approach for X\"\n\n## Research - Use Web Search\n\nFor tasks requiring external knowledge, USE THE WEB TOOL. Don't fabricate information.\n\n### When to Search\n- Literature review / prior work / citations needed\n- Technical topics you're not certain about\n- Finding libraries, APIs, best practices\n- Current versions, recent changes, news\n- Anything where accuracy matters more than speed\n\n### Research Workflow\n```\n1. web(command='search', query='specific terms here')\n   \u2192 Get list of sources with URLs\n\n2. web(command='fetch', url='promising_url')\n   \u2192 Read full content from best sources\n\n3. Extract specific information:\n   - Author names and years for citations\n   - Key findings, numbers, facts\n   - Code examples, API details\n\n4. Cite sources in your output:\n   - \"According to Smith et al. (2023)...\"\n   - \"Based on the official documentation...\"\n```\n\n### Search Tips\n- Be specific: \"React useState hook example 2024\" not \"React help\"\n- Search multiple times with different queries\n- Prioritize peer_reviewed and preprint sources for citations\n- Fetch and read sources before citing them\n\n### DO NOT\n- Make up citations or paper names\n- Fabricate statistics or benchmark numbers\n- Claim knowledge you haven't verified\n- Skip research for topics requiring accuracy\n\n## Phases\n\n### 1. Understand\n- Read relevant files/context first\n- Use web search for external knowledge (don't fabricate)\n- Use sub-agents (researcher, explorer) for large codebases\n- Don't assume - verify\n\n### 2. Plan\n- Use todo tool to list ALL components/steps\n- Identify dependencies between steps\n- DO NOT start implementation until todos exist\n\n### 3. Execute\n- One component at a time\n- Test each piece before moving on (run it, check output)\n- Mark todos complete as you go\n\n### 4. Validate\n- Verify all todos completed\n- Test integration\n- If unstable: create simplified working version\n\n## Verification Before Completion - CRITICAL\n\nNEVER mark a task complete without verification. This is the #1 cause of failed tasks.\n\n### What Requires Verification\n\n| Task Type | Verification Required |\n|-----------|----------------------|\n| Code that produces output | Run it, check output is correct |\n| Scripts/programs | Execute and verify no errors |\n| Tests | Run tests, verify they pass |\n| Builds | Build succeeds without errors |\n| Data processing | Output data exists and is valid |\n| Optimization | Results meet stated targets |\n| File creation | File exists with expected content |\n\n### Verification Pattern\n\n```\n1. Define success criteria BEFORE starting\n   - What output should exist?\n   - What values should be achieved?\n   - What should NOT happen (no errors, no crashes)?\n\n2. After implementation, RUN verification\n   - Execute: python script.py, npm test, etc.\n   - Check output against criteria\n   - Parse results for key metrics\n\n3. Only mark complete if ALL criteria pass\n   - If partial success \u2192 iterate, don't complete\n   - If blocked \u2192 note what's missing, ask user\n```\n\n### Common Verification Commands\n\n**By Language:**\n- Python: `python script.py`, `pytest`, `python -c \"from X import Y\"`\n- JavaScript/Node: `node script.js`, `npm test`, `npm run build`\n- TypeScript: `npx ts-node script.ts`, `npm test`\n- Go: `go run main.go`, `go test ./...`\n- Rust: `cargo run`, `cargo test`\n- Java: `mvn test`, `gradle test`\n- Shell: `bash script.sh`, `./script.sh`\n\n**General:**\n- File exists: `ls -la path/to/file` or `test -f path/to/file`\n- JSON valid: `cat file.json | head` (check structure)\n- Build succeeds: Check exit code is 0\n- Output correct: Compare against expected values\n\n### Anti-Pattern: DO NOT DO THIS\n\n```\n\u274c Write code \u2192 mark complete (without running)\n\u274c \"Should work\" \u2192 mark complete (without testing)\n\u274c Partial results \u2192 mark complete (targets not met)\n```\n\n## Error Recovery\n\n- Same error 3+ times \u2192 STOP. Try different approach.\n- Timeout \u2192 Start simpler, add complexity\n- Blocked \u2192 Ask user or pivot\n\n### Preemptive Fixes\n- Type errors: check types match before operations\n- Serialization: ensure objects are serializable (convert arrays, handle special types)\n- Imports/dependencies: verify modules exist before using them\n- Async issues: handle promises/callbacks properly (JS), use await (Python/JS)\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Read before modifying\n- Be concise\n- Don't over-engineer\n- If blocked: ask user or pivot strategy\n\n## Task Data Flow - CRITICAL\n\nTasks pass data to each other via artifacts. Use the `produces` and `target` fields.\n\n### Declaring Outputs (produces)\n\nWhen creating a task that generates output, declare what it produces:\n\n```\n{\n  \"content\": \"Research metasurface designs\",\n  \"produces\": \"file:_outputs/research_data.json\",  # File artifact\n  \"result_key\": \"research_data\"  # Key for dependents to access\n}\n```\n\nArtifact types:\n- `file:<path>` - File that must exist when task completes\n- `data` - Structured data returned as result\n- `metrics` - Numeric results\n\n### Consuming Inputs\n\nDependent tasks automatically receive predecessor outputs via `result_key`:\n\n```\n# Task 1 produces research_data.json with result_key=\"research_data\"\n# Task 2 depends_on=[\"task_1\"]\n# \u2192 Task 2 receives research_data in its inputs\n```\n\n**CRITICAL**: When starting a dependent task, READ the predecessor's output file first.\nDo NOT regenerate data from memory - use the actual artifact.\n\n### Setting Targets\n\nFor optimization/metric tasks, set success criteria:\n\n```\n{\n  \"content\": \"Optimize for 2\u03c0 phase coverage\",\n  \"target\": {\"metric\": \"phase_coverage\", \"operator\": \">=\", \"value\": 6.28}\n}\n```\n\nThe task will FAIL if the target is not met. Do not mark complete manually.\n\n### Data Flow Pattern\n\n1. Research task \u2192 `produces: \"file:_outputs/evidence.json\"` \u2192 creates file with extracted data\n2. Build task \u2192 `depends_on: [\"research\"]` \u2192 READS evidence.json \u2192 uses that data\n3. Optimize task \u2192 `target: {\"metric\": \"X\", \"operator\": \">=\", \"value\": Y}` \u2192 iterates until target met\n4. Validate task \u2192 reads optimization results \u2192 confirms targets achieved\n\n### Rules\n\n- DO NOT mark task complete without creating declared artifact\n- DO NOT start dependent task without reading predecessor's artifact file\n- DO NOT mark optimization complete if target not met - keep iterating\n- Dependent tasks MUST use predecessor data, not regenerate from memory\n\nWorking directory: /Users/shrutibadhwar/Documents/2026/SWERuns/check\n",

These requirements are then mapped onto specialized metasurface microstructures, ensuring precise electromagnetic response control. Artificial intelligence (AI) serves as a unifying thread by accelerating inverse design through efficient navigation of high-dimensional parameter spaces and by enhancing imaging performance via AI-driven computational reconstruction algorithms. We synthesize the remarkable performance of metasurfaces across six electromagnetic response control methods in nine imaging domains and categorize three main design approaches\u2014physically-driven, meta-heuristic, and AI-driven methods\u2014while providing a detailed analysis of six primary encoding and decoding strategies and eight common AI techniques. Additionally, nine prospective research directions are highlighted. The review emphasizes that future metasurface imaging systems will leverage electromagnetic response control to link performance with metasurface structure, with AI technology playing a central role in this process.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n###  [Current-diffusion model for metasurface structure discoveries with spatial-frequency dynamics ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01162-z?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle 31 December 2025\n\n###  [AI for optical metasurface ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44310-024-00037-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 02 September 2024\n\n###  [A guidance to intelligent metamaterials and metamaterials intelligence ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56122-3?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 29 January 2025\n\n## Introduction\n\nImaging technology is fundamental to a wide range of scientific and industrial domains, significantly advancing humanity\u2019s ability to explore both the microscopic and cosmic scales. From revealing molecular details within the human body to observing distant celestial phenomena, imaging technology has played a crucial role in driving breakthroughs in medicine, astrophysics, security, and more. Traditional optical systems, which are mainly based on refractive and diffractive elements, have been instrumental in enabling multidimensional high-resolution data capture[1](/articles/s44310-025-00081-6#ref-CR1 \"Peng, Y. et al. Metalens in improving imaging quality: advancements, challenges, and prospects for future display. Laser Photonics Rev 18, 2300731 \\(2024\\).\"),[2](/articles/s44310-025-00081-6#ref-CR2 \"Zou, X. et al. Advanced optical imaging based on metasurfaces. Adv. Opt. Mater. 12, 2203149 \\(2024\\).\"). However, these systems are often burdened with inherent limitations, such as bulkiness, material dispersion, and manufacturing complexities. Although computational imaging3,4,[5](/articles/s44310-025-00081-6#ref-CR5 \"Altmann, Y. et al. Quantum-inspired computational imaging. Science 361, eaat2298 \\(2018\\).\") has partially mitigated these constraints through algorithmic post-processing, persistent bulkiness and performance limits continue to pose significant challenges.\n\nMetasurface technology, distinguished by its exceptional ability to manipulate broad electromagnetic properties on a subwavelength scale, has emerged as a promising solution to overcome these long-standing barriers in optical imaging6,7,[8](/articles/s44310-025-00081-6#ref-CR8 \"Zhou, H. et al. Optical computing metasurfaces: applications and advances. Nanophotonics 13, 419\u2013441 \\(2024\\).\"). Unlike traditional optics, which relies primarily on refraction or reflection, metasurfaces precisely control electromagnetic waves at the subwavelength scale through carefully engineered nanostructures, enabling multifunctional optical responses. These nanostructures enable tunable control over various electromagnetic responses, offering the potential for ultrathin devices with significantly enhanced functionality. As a subclass of metasurfaces tailored for focusing tasks, metalenses are treated in this work under a consistent terminology framework. By eliminating bulky refractive components and confining optical interactions to the surface, metasurfaces foster new functionalities, such as achromatic imaging, expanded field of view imaging, expanded depth of field imaging, resolution enhancement imaging, multidimensional imaging, optical feature enhancement imaging, holographic imaging, functional integration imaging and compact integration imaging, all achieved within a compact optical layer9,10,[11](/articles/s44310-025-00081-6#ref-CR11 \"Li, R. et al. Design of ultra-thin underwater acoustic metasurface for broadband low-frequency diffuse reflection by deep neural networks. Sci. Rep. 12, 12037 \\(2022\\).\"). Especially in recent years, breakthroughs, such as reconfigurable metasurfaces based on phase-change materials12,13,14,[15](/articles/s44310-025-00081-6#ref-CR15 \"Popescu, C. C. et al. Electrically reconfigurable phase-change transmissive metasurface. Adv. Mater. 36, 2400627 \\(2024\\).\"), and high-throughput nanoprinting techniques capable of achieving sub-100 nm resolution across centimeter-scale areas16,17,18,[19](/articles/s44310-025-00081-6#ref-CR19 \"Yang, W., Zhou, J., Tsai, D. P. & Xiao, S. Advanced manufacturing of dielectric meta-devices. Photon. Insights 3, R04\u2013R04 \\(2024\\).\"), have greatly improved the tunability, scalability, and manufacturability of metasurface imaging systems, further strengthening their prospects for next-generation imaging.\n\nBeyond their compact nature, the primary advantage of metasurfaces in imaging systems lies in their capacity for finely tuned electromagnetic control20,21,[22](/articles/s44310-025-00081-6#ref-CR22 \"Shaltout, \n\n...

It is generally considered that the optical thickness of the unit cell of a PB-phase metasurface is _\u03bb_ /2, i.e., a half-waveplate for polarization conversion. It is found that the _\u03bb_ /2 is not essential for achieving a full 2 _\u03c0_ modulation. Nevertheless, a _\u03bb_ /2 thickness is still needed for a high polarization conversion efficiency. Moreover, a gradient phase metasurface is designed. With the help of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, the wavefront errors of the gradient phase metasurface are reduced by fine-tuning the rotation angle of the nanofins. The diffraction efficiency of the gradient phase metasurface is thus improved from 73.4% to 87.3%. This design rule can be utilized to optimize the efficiency of phase-type meta-devices, such as meta-deflectors and metalenses.\n\n**Keywords:** PB-phase, metasurface, polarization\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nRecently, Pancharatnam\u2013Berry (PB) metasurfaces [1,2], based on design concept regarding the geometric phase, have attracted intense attention due to their strong capabilities in controlling circular-polarized (CP) waves [3]. We consider the case of two identical metasurface unit cells illuminated by the same CP light, where the second one is rotated by an angle _\u03b8 p_ with respect to the first one. The spin-flipped components of the waves, scattered by the two unit cells, will differ only with a phase factor _e i2\u03b8p_. This phase difference, termed as the PB-phase, is independent of the frequency. This dispersion-less phase modulation ability allows the PB-phase metasurface to control the phase much easier compared to other resonance-based metasurfaces. However, the unavoidable Ohmic heat dissipation loss of metals significantly degrades the performances of metasurfaces made by plasmonic structures [4]. To address the heat dissipation loss of metals, dielectric metasurfaces are proposed [5,6]. Low-loss dielectric resonators can also support both electric and magnetic resonances with mechanism governed by the Mie resonances [7]. For the lossless case, a single electric resonator exhibits a Lorentz-type response with a maximum phase variation of _\u03c0_ and with a scattering amplitude tightly linked with the phase variation. Nevertheless, with an optically thick-enough nanofin with optical anisotropy, the strict _\u03c0_ limit is no longer applicable on the single electric resonator due to the magnetic dipole resonance arisen from the circulating displacement currents within the nanofin. In general, by overlapping the electric and magnetic resonances in frequency via adjusting the resonator\u2019s geometry, it is possible to achieve a phase variation covering the entire 2 _\u03c0_ range with high transmission [8,9].\n\nAs a 100% efficient PB metasurface in transmission geometry, a perfectly transparent unit cell\n\n...

For this purpose, a graphene-based switchable power divider is designed and integrated with nano-antennas to control the flow of the light entering the device. To achieve a higher angular accuracy in the radiated beams, a new algorithm is proposed and utilized to optimize the location of feeding nano-antennas in accordance with the reflective meta-lens. In order to achieve a minimum fluctuation in the light intensity when the beams are rotated in the space, an algorithm is developed to select optimum unit cells for the engineered meta-lens. The whole device is numerically analyzed using Electromagnetic full-wave simulations illustrating an optical beam steering with high accuracy (better than 1 degree) in the beam direction, and a low variation (less than 1 dB) in the radiated light intensity. The proposed integrated device can be used for many applications such as inter- and intra-chip optical interconnects, optical wireless communication systems, and advanced integrated LIDARs.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n###  [Beam steering at the nanosecond time scale with an atomically thin reflector ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29976-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 14 June 2022\n\n###  [Beam-steering of dielectric flat lens nanoantenna with elliptical patch based on antenna displacement for optical wireless applications ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43149-z?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 25 September 2023\n\n###  [Beam steering for single antenna element using different optical lens ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-03751-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 29 May 2025\n\n## Introduction\n\nOptical nano-antennas are devices designed to control the light profile in micro and nanometer dimensions1,2,3,[4](/articles/s41598-023-33939-w#ref-CR4 \"Llatser, I., Kremers, C., Cabellos-Aparicio, A., Jornet, J.

Therefore, they can be used to realize various optical components. In particular, metasurfaces can be used to realize lenses, so-called metalenses. In the last decade, metalenses have been actively studied and developed. In this review, we firstly introduce the fundamental principles of metalenses in terms of materials, phase modulation method, and design method. Based on these principles, the functionalities and the applications can consequently be realized. Metalenses have a much larger number of degrees of freedom compared with that of existing refractive or diffractive lenses. Thus, they afford functionalities such as tunability, high numerical aperture, and aberration correction. Metalenses with these functionalities can be applied in various optical systems such as imaging systems and spectrometers. Finally, we discuss the future applications of metalenses.\n\n### Graphical Abstract\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n###  [Optical metalenses: fundamentals, dispersion manipulation, and applications ](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12200-022-00017-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 18 May 2022\n\n###  [Metalenses: from design principles to functional applications ](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12200-021-1201-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle 07 April 2021\n\n###  [Metasurface optics for imaging applications ](https://link.springer.com/10.1557/mrs.2020.64?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle 01 March 2020\n\n### Explore related subjects\n\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\n\n  * [Applied Optics](/subjects/applied-optics)\n  * [Integrated Optics](/subjects/integrated-optics)\n  * [Metamaterials](/subjects/metamaterials)\n  * [Near -field Optics](/subjects/near-field-optics)\n  * [Optical Materials](/subjects/optical-materials)\n  * [Sub-wavelength Optics](/subjects/sub-wavelength-optics)\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nMetasurfaces can potentially replace existing optical components with ultrathin manners. By arranging subwavelength scatterers (i.e., meta-atoms), the characteristics of light, such as the phase [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,[16](/article/10.1186/s40580-023-00372-8#ref-CR16 \"L.

Hu et al., Dielectric metasurface zone plate for the generation of focusing vortex beams. PhotoniX. 2\\(1\\), 10 \\(2021\\)\")], can be manipulated. Among these, studies have actively investigated a metasurface that manipulates the phase, namely, a phase gradient metasurface. Fundamental developments of the phase gradient metasurface are based on the material and phase modulation method. A meta-atom can behave like a nanoresonator, nanowaveguide, and half-wave plate, leading to a resonant phase, propagation phase, and geometric phase, respectively. The corresponding phase modulation methods change as the material transitions from a metal to a dielectric in the visible region. Implementing localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based resonant and geometric phases in a metal results in considerable ohmic loss [[31](/article/10.1186/s40580-023-00372-8#ref-CR31 \"E.

By contrast, Mie-resonance-based resonant, propagation, and geometric phases can be implemented in a dielectric with low loss [40,41,[42](/article/10.1186/s40580-023-00372-8#ref-CR42 \"M.

One significant challenge in implementing applications for metalens is the efficient fabrication of large-scale nanostructures with high resolution, robustness and uniform patterning. In this review, we first introduced the manufacturing techniques compatible with metasurfaces fabrication in detail, including masked lithography, maskless lithography, and additive manufacturing, discussed the limitations and provided some insights. Next, we introduced the applications of metalens from the perspective of non-imaging and imaging optics fields. Metalens can enhance the illumination effect, shape beams, and improve the energy conversion efficiency in non-imaging optics. In imaging optics, the role of metalens in replacing traditional optical components in lithography, astronomical observation, microscopic and endoscopic systems is demonstrated. Finally, the challenges that the metalens facing on the road to commercial application are discussed, and the field\u2019s future development is prospected.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n###  [Metrology of metasurfaces: optical properties ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44310-024-00051-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 31 January 2025\n\n###  [Off-axis metasurfaces for folded flat optics ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41123-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 12 September 2023\n\n###  [Multifaceted control of focal points along an arbitrary 3D curved trajectory ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-024-01565-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 02 September 2024\n\n## Introduction\n\nTraditional optical elements are based on the properties of light absorption, refraction and reflection, and use the accumulation of optical path in the medium to regulate the phase, amplitude and polarization of light, so the traditional optical elements are thick and heavy, and cannot adapt to the current development trend of optical components miniaturization. Therefore, the development of artificial micro/nano optical devices and materials has become the starting point for people to study light, and two major fields have been developed: metamaterials and metasurfaces.\n\nIn 1996, the Pendry team[1](/articles/s41378-025-01064-5#ref-CR1 \"Pendry, J. B. et al. Extremely low frequency plasmons in metallic mesostructures. Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 4773 \\(1996\\).\") proposed periodic structures built of very thin metal wires, whose equivalent plasma frequency changes with the distance between metal wires and the radius of metal wires. Adjusting the equivalent plasma frequency to make it greater than the operating frequency can achieve a negative dielectric constant. Then, in 1999, the Pendry team[2](/articles/s41378-025-01064-5#ref-CR2 \"Pendry, J. B. et al. Magnetism from conductors and enhanced nonlinear phenomena. IEEE Trans. Microw. Theory Technol. 47, 2075\u20132084 \\(1999\\).\") proposed the split ring structure array built from nonmagnetic conducting sheets. It achieves equivalent negative permeability by changing the size parameters of its cell structure and spacing. Next, in 2000, the Smith team[3](/articles/s41378-025-01064-5#ref-CR3 \"Smith, D. R. et al. Composite medium with simultaneously negative permeability and permittivity. Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 4184 \\(2000\\).\") demonstrated a composite medium, the \u201cleft-handed\u201d medium, based on split rings and wires in periodic array, which concurrently shows negative effective permeability and permittivity simultaneously in a frequency region at the microwave band. By artificially manipulating and designing materials\u2019 optical and electromagnetic effects to guide light propagation, this idea has gradually become a reality with the development of advanced micro/nano processing techniques, and researchers began to study metamaterials4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,[15](/articles/s41378-025-01064-5#ref-CR15 \"Jiang, L. et al. Terahertz high and near-zero refractive index metamaterials by double layer metal ring microstructure. Opt. Laser Technol. 123, 105949 \\(2020\\).\"). Metamaterials have been widely studied in the microwave or terahertz band. However, in the optical wave band, the processing and preparation of metamaterials are complicated and high cost. Compared with metamaterials, planar artificial optical structures are relatively easy to fabricate and have lower loss in the process of interacting with light waves, so they have received extensive attention and research.\n\nIn 2011, the Capasso team[16](/articles/s41378-025-01064-5#ref-CR16 \"Yu, N. et al. Light propagation with phase discontinuities: generalized laws of reflection and refraction. science 334, 333\u2013337 \\(2011\\).\") proposed the generalized Snell\u2019s Law, and demonstrated V-shaped antennas with diverse structural parameters to realize the regulation of the phase of linearly polarized light waves from 0 to 2\u03c0 at subwavelength scale, successfully realizing the manipulation of the wavefront of transmitted light. The metasurfaces can effectively control the phase of the light wave at the subwavelength scale to control the wavefront of the light wave17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,[28](/articles/s41378-025-01064-5#ref-CR28 \"Cheng, H. et al.
